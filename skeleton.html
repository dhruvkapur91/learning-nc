<p><code>nc</code>, as I am told, is a Swiss army knife of all things network. This tool has baffled me for long and it's time I learn how to wield this weapon (for ‚úåÔ∏è)</p>
<p>Ultimately I would like to be able to sniff communication between 2 processes, but I'm unsure if that's going to be possible using nc. This is what motivates this post.</p>

<p>As the documentation suggests, NetCat, a simple unix utility, enables you to do anything under the Sun (üåû) involving TCP (default) or UDP (<code>-u</code> flag).
Things like -</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening connections</li>
<li>Sending and receiving data</li>
<li>Port Scanning</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="netcatasaclient">NetCat as a Client</h2>
<p>Most basic usage starts with <code>nc &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;</code> creating a TCP connection to host on that port. It sends the standard input (of your terminal) through the connection to the host, and prints whatever it gets on to the standard output (of your terminal) </p>

<p>Did you notice that I pressed enter twice? Why did I do that?  (ü§î)
Because one for Server to know that you're done. Another for nc to know that you're done.</p>
<h2 id="netcatasaserver">NetCat as a Server</h2>
<p>It can listen to inbound connections.</p>

<p>If its server or client.. In some sense it acts more like a pipe.</p>
