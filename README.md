`nc`, as I am told, is a Swiss army knife of all things network. This tool has baffled me for long and it's time I learn how to wield this weapon (for ‚úåÔ∏è)

Ultimately I would like to be able to sniff communication between 2 processes, but I'm unsure if that's going to be possible using nc. This is what motivates this post.
