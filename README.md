`nc`, as I am told, is a Swiss army knife of all things network. This tool has baffled me for long and it's time I learn how to wield this weapon (for ‚úåÔ∏è)

Ultimately I would like to be able to sniff communication between 2 processes, but I'm unsure if that's going to be possible using nc. This is what motivates this post.

# Did you know?
1. What is the request your browser send when you type any URL? If not, can `nc` help you find it?

# Introductions  (üëã NetCat)
As the documentation suggests, NetCat, a simple unix utility, enables you to do anything under the Sun (üåû) involving TCP (default) or UDP (`-u` flag).
Things like -
- Opening connections
- Sending and receiving data
- Port Scanning

## NetCat as a Client
Most basic usage starts with `nc <host> <port>` creating a TCP connection to host on that port. It sends the standard input (of your terminal) through the connection to the host, and prints whatever it gets on to the standard output (of your terminal) 

### Making a GET request
<script id="asciicast-339449" src="https://asciinema.org/a/339449.js" async></script>

How many enters did I press there?
Did you notice that I pressed enter twice? Why did I do that?  (ü§î)
Because one for Server to know that you're done. Another for nc to know that you're done.

Is this a lot of typing you say? That's where Bash scripting can come to rescue. Checkout this - 
```
printf 'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n' | nc example.com 80
```
We use `printf` to send our preformatted message. I did indeed press 2 enters, should be clear now :) 

We can ofcourse hit a locally running server, I have included a docker based file server in this repository to showcase that.  You could either checkout the repository or run this in GitPod too.

We can go a step futher, `nc` can actually download files for you. Lets try that out.

## NetCat as a Server
It can listen to inbound connections.


## NetCat doesn't really care
If its server or client.. In some sense it acts more like a pipe.

## NetCat is like better telnet

## You can even watch a movie!
- [Like this one](https://asciinema.org/a/319461)

## Using as a terminal streaming tool

## Using as stream generator

## Checking if port is open

## Command line options
- -C: Sending CRLF 

# TODOs
- Create an artwork for nc
- Create a podcast for nc, would it make sense?
- Create a video for nc, would it make sense?
- Create a zine for nc, would it make sense?
